# Nemo Actions & Cinnamon Scripts

A collection of custom context menu actions for the Nemo file manager, along with some [miscellaneous feature scripts](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts#cinnamon-scripts) intended for the Cinnamon desktop environment.

Also included is a [GTK over-ride](https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts#miscellaneous-tweaks) file to increase the width of GTK application scrollbars, improve the visibility of labels on desktop icons, and improve the visibility of text on the cinnamon lock-screen / screen-saver.

# Nemo Actions

Nemo actions add additional context menu items to the right click menu in the Nemo file manager and on the Cinnamon desktop.

An action can be added to Nemo by saving it's definition file with the file extension `.nemo_action` in `~/.local/share/nemo/actions`

Some actions in this repo also require an associated shell script. These should be saved in `~/.local/share/nemo/actions/scripts` and be made executable

## Nemo Action installation

These instructions assume a Debian/Ubuntu based distro for the commands to install dependencies. For users of other distros please replace `sudo apt` woth the equivalent for your distro's package management system.

First install git

`sudo apt install git`

Then clone this repo

`git clone https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts.git`

Having cloned the repo you can either install all of the actions using the commands below or refer to the index of actions to install individual actions.

To install all of the nemo actions

`cp -rv ./nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/.local/share/nemo/actions/ ~/.local/share/nemo`

Install other dependencies used by the actions

`sudo apt install zenity xdotool wmctrl gprename mediainfo-gui shellcheck searchmonkey tree imagemagick`

Either `sudo apt install xplayer` or `sudo apt install ffmpeg ffmpegthumbnailer`

Open Nemo > Preferences > Plugins and review any actions you wish to disable.

## Nemo Action updating

In a terminal navigate to the `nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts` folder created when you originally cloned the repo

e.g `cd nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts`

Once in the correct folder update your local copy with the latest commits, before reinstalling your actions.

`git pull origin; cd ..`

### General Actions

#### Edit as other user actions

These actions allow you to open text files with a password prompt for elevated privileges if necessary from a regular instance of Nemo. They will all open the file with the specified text-editor using sudoedit to elevate privileges as the owner of the file if that is not the user. The could be as root or another user on the system.

Three versions are supplied, using the CLI text editor Nano, Linux Mint's default GUI text editor Xed and finally the GUI text editor Geany. If you have a different preferred text editor the actions and scripts can easily be modified to suit your needs. The actions invoking a GUI text editor require zenity.

#### Add to desktop actions

Two actions to quickly create a desktop link to a selected directory.
Add link to desktop creates a link desktop file with the link emblem on the icon. However these links function slightly differently from a regular symlink as when opened it will open the original target location.
Add launcher to desktop will result in a plain folder without a link emblem. The function is otherwise identical to add link to desktop

##### Add link to desktop

#### Bulk rename actions

Both these actions open the bulk rename utility GPrename. One action is for a single folder selection to bulk rename files in that folder.
The other is for multiple selections and opens GPrename in the parent folder.

`sudo apt install gprename`

#### Apply custom emblems

This action allows the user to create and set custom emblems derived from image files, album art or video thumbnails to files and directories.
For directories there is an option to use a random emblem generated from the directory contents and it can be run recursively on the selected directory and it's sub-directories.

Requires zenity, wmctrl, imagemagick and either xplayer or ffmpeg and ffmpegthumbnailer to be installed.

`sudo apt install zenity wmctrl imagemagick`

Either `sudo apt install xplayer` or `sudo apt install ffmpeg ffmpegthumbnailer`

#### Set folder view recursively

This action allows the user to set default folder view (list, compact or icon) and zoom level recursively to a directory and it's sub-directories.

Requires zenity, wmctrl, and gio. Mint users should be aware that gio is only available in Mint 19 and later.

# Cinnamon Scripts

This is a small selection of feature scripts that add new features or improve existing features for the Cinnamon desktop.

## Cinnamon Scripts Installation

These instructions assume a Debian/Ubuntu based distro for the commands to install dependencies. For users of other distros please replace `sudo apt` woth the equivalent for your distro's package management system.

They also assume your distro is set up to automatically add `~/.local/bin/` to your $PATH when it exists. This is the case in Linux Mint main edition but not LMDE for example.

If after installation scripts are not autostarting on login check the output of `echo $PATH`. If the output does not include `~/.local/bin/` this can normally be rectified by adding the string `PATH=~/.local/bin/:$PATH` to `~/.profile`

First install git

`sudo apt install git`

Then clone this repo if you haven't already.

`git clone https://github.com/smurphos/nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts.git`

Having cloned the repo you can either install all of the scripts using the commands below or refer to the index of scripts to install individual scripts.

To install all of the cinnamon scripts

`cp -rv ./nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/.local/bin/ ~/.local`

`sudo cp -r ./nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/opt/login_screen_random_background.sh /opt`

To install autostart entries for relevant scripts

`cp -rv ./nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts/.config/autostart/ ~/.config`

Install dependencies required by the scripts

`sudo apt install zenity xdotool wmctrl`

See the scripts index for any other script specific setup recommendations.

Log off and back on.

## Cinnamon Script updating

In a terminal navigate to the `nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts` folder created when you originally cloned the repo

e.g `cd nemo_actions_and_cinnamon_scripts`

Once in the correct folder update your local copy with the latest commits, before reinstalling your scripts.

`git pull origin; cd ..`

Login Screen Random Background is intended to be run from the root crontab. To set up run

`sudo crontab -e`

In the CLI text editor that opens add the following lines to the bottom of the file.
Ctrl-O, Enter, Ctrl-X to save the new crontab entries. This will run the script on boot and every half an hour.

```
@reboot /opt/login_screen_random_background.sh
0,30 * * * * /opt/login_screen_random_background.sh

#### Opacify Windows

This script allows the user to set default opacity levels for open windows based on the window status and type. For example unfocused windows can be translucent whilst focused windows are opaque.
The effect is independent of the users theme and can be used with any GTK theme. It is intended to be run on user login as a startup application. Requires xdotool and wmctrl - `sudo apt install xdotool wmctrl`

#### Battery Event Warnings

This script uses zenity - `sudo apt install zenity` to open a warning window on battery low and critically low events. This can be helpful if gaming or watching full screen video whilst running on battery as the zenity window will demand attention.
It is intended to be run on user login as a startup application. Please note the script modifies Cinnamon's default thresholds for Low & Critical battery events and actions. Please review the script if you want to set these thresholds to your preference.

# Miscellaneous tweaks

## GTK over-ride for Cinnamon
